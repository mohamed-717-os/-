<h2>The Rich History of Seafood Congee</h2>
  <pre> <p> Before the industrial urbanization and economic boom in Guangdong, locals worked predominantly in the seafood and fishing industry. There were many fishing villages in Lychee Bay, 
    and fishermen would pack their pots of congee before going off to work. 
    After their morning shift, 
    they would add their fresh catches to the rice porridge for a boost of protein and flavor. 

    Over time, these fishermen started to sell the congee with their daily harvest on their little boats. 
    Thatâ€™s why this kind of congee is called tang jai jook, which translates to little boat porridge. 
    It is also known as sampan jook, which translates to three plank congee, referring to the little boats made of planks. 
    
    While there are many recipes and variations of seafood congee,
     this recipe is based on the congee from my favorite childhood restaurant in Chinatown in New York: Wing Wong and Big Wong .

<pre>
    
        <h3> 3.Cook the congee:</h3>
    <p>    Add the water to a pot over high heat and bring to a rolling boil. 
        Lower the heat to medium and add the rinsed and drained rice. 
        With a spatula or wooden spoon, give the rice a gentle stir so it is evenly distributed in the pot.
        
        Place the lid slightly ajar on top of the pot and adjust the heat to maintain a low simmer. 
        Cook the congee, without stirring, until the outline of the grains of rice is no longer visible, 1 1/2 hours.</p>

  <h3>4.Add the meat and seafood and cook:</h3>
  <p>  Remove the lid and gently stir the congee. 
    If desired, you can add additional water for a looser consistency. 
    
    Add the salted pork and calamari strips.
    Stir to submerge them in the congee. Stir frequently to prevent the protein from sticking to the pot.
    Cook until the meat is no longer pink, another 10 to 15 minutes. Add salt to taste, if needed.
