    Chicken Marsala is a succulent dish that features thinly sliced pieces of pan-fried chicken breast and mushrooms in a reduced wine sauce.
     Its name comes from the fortified Italian wine used to give the dish its trademark deep,
     nutty, and slightly sweet flavor.

<dl>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the chicken</li>
<dd><ul type="disc"><li> Slice each chicken breast carefully in half lengthwise (horizontally) and place one at a time, 
    between 2 sheets of cling wrap or in a ziploc freezer bag.
    Carefully flatten the chicken breasts with a rolling pin until they are approximately ¼ inch thick. 
    Don’t pound the breasts too hard as it could tear apart the breast. Ideally,
    you want flattened chicken breasts to a uniform thickness. 
    Season both sides of each chicken breast with salt and pepper.
    Prepare a shallow plate with flour and dip the chicken into the flour, evenly coating on both sides. Set aside.</li></ul></dd>
<li>Sear the chicken</li>
<dd><ul type="disc"><li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high for 2 minutes until the hot oil sizzles. 
    Sear the chicken for about 5 minutes per side until golden brown and fully cooked through.
    The internal temperature for the chicken should reach 165F.
    Transfer the chicken to a plate.</li></ul></dd>
<li>Make the creamy mushroom sauce</li>
<dd> <ul type="disc"><li>In the same skillet, melt butter and sauté mushrooms until golden brown on both sides, 
    about 5 minutes. Add a little more olive oil,
    if needed. Stir in flour,
    Italian seasoning and garlic and sauté until fragrant, 
    about 1 minute. Pour in marsala wine, chicken broth,
    and cream and whisk well until the sauce is smooth and uniform. Reduce heat to medium and bring the sauce to a simmer until thickened to a desired consistency,
    about 4-5 minutes.</li></ul></dd>
<li>Assemble and serve</li>
<dd><ul type="disc"><li>Return the chicken to skillet and toss well to coat,
    allowing the chicken to cook and soak in the sauce for 1-2 minutes. 
    Garnish with parsley and serve immediately with pasta, rice,
    or over mashed potatoes.</li></ul></dd>
