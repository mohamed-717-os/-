    <h2>History Of Shrimp Tempura </h2>
    <p>
        The Japanese have a unique ability to take foreign food and modify <br>
        it to Japanese tastes, creating something totally new and original,<br>
        and tempura is a prime example.<br>
        This method of frying food was introduced in the 1600s by Portuguese missionaries.<br>
        The original dish has disappeared, but it was a meal meant for Lent,<br>
        when many Christian denominations are forbidden to eat meat. In fact,<br>
        the name tempura comes from the Latin ad tempora cuaresme, which means<br>
        in the time of Lent. 'The Japanese mistook this as <br>
        the dish's name and called it tempura.<br>
        Tempura was introduced around the commercial port city of Nagasaki. <br>
        At the time, Japan was closed off from the rest of the world.<br>
        Its only contact was through Portuguese, Dutch and Chinese traders <br>
        and missionaries in this port city.

    <h2>How to Make this Shrimp Tempura recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the shrimp. Make shallow slits into the inner part of each shrimp. <br>
            I usually make 5 slits for each shrimp. <br>
            Separating the shrimp like this will prevent your <br>
            shrimp from curling during the frying process. <br>
            This process is also called “stretching” the shrimp.

        <li>
            Mix up the batter.
            Mix the dry tempura mix with cold water in a large bowl. <br>
            Pat the shrimp dry and dip them into the batter.
         </li>
         <li>
            Dip and fry. Fry the battered shrimp in a pot of oil <br>
            over medium-high heat (about 375 degrees Fahrenheit) <br>
            until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes
         </li>

    </ol>
    <h3>How long do you fry the shrimp?</h3>
    <p>
         The best way to fry anything, especially shrimp,<br>
         is by heating the oil to the correct temperature. <br>
         You will want to have the thermometer read 375 degrees Fahrenheit. <br>
         Once the temperature is right,<br>
         drop in the battered tempura and fry for about 2-3 minutes.

    <h3>Tips for the crunchiest Shrimp Tempura:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Use the right oil- It’s important to use an oil with a high smoke point, so it doesn’t burn. <br>
            Traditionally, tempura is fried in unrefined (untoasted) sesame oil. <br>
            But if you don’t have any of that, then you can use sunflower, <br>
            vegetable, canola, or peanut for this shrimp tempura recipe.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut slits into the shrimp- Make shallow slits into the inner part of <br>
            each shrimp to prevent them from curling during the frying process. <br>
            This makes them easier to eat and serve in sushi rolls.
        </li>
        <li>
            Keep the oil temperature steady- Make sure that the oil stays <br>
            between 350 and 375 degrees Fahrenheit because this will give your shrimp tempura an even<br>
            crispness and golden color. If the oil gets too cool, you’ll get soggy shrimp; <br>
            too hot and the batter will turn brown while the inside is raw.
        </li>
    </ol>
