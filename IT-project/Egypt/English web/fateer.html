<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<ul>
	<li>All purpose flour: you'll need 4 cups or 540 grams. You cannot make feteer with whole wheat flour, this is not how things roll with feteer.</li>
	<li>Water: just tap water and we are going to need anywhere from 1 to 1 and a half cup.</li>
	<li>Salt: we'll need about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt.</li>
	<li>Butter/ghee or oil: we'll need about 1 cup of melted butter and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup oil. Many people like to use <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup of butter and the rest is oil. Others use ghee as well.</li>	
</ul>
<h2>How to make fateer meshaltet</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Mix the flour and salt then pour one cup of water and start kneading. If you feel the dough is still not coming together or too dry, 
	<br>gradually add the remaining water until you get a dough that is very elastic so that when you pull it and it won't be torn.</li>
	<br><li>Let the dough rest for just 10 minutes then divide the dough into 6-8 balls depending on the size you want for your feteer. 
	<br>Warm up the butter/ghee or oil you are using and pour into a deep bowl. Immerse the dough balls into the warm butter. Let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
	<br><li>Roll the first ball with your hands to be very very thin that you can see your countertop through.</li>
	<br><li>Fold the dough over itself to form a square brushing in between folds with butter. Set aside and start rolling the next ball.</li>
	<br><li>Roll the second one thin as we have done for the first ball. Place the previous one on the middle seam side down. 
	<br>Fold the outer one over brushing with more butter as you fold. Set aside.</li>
	<br><li>Keep doing this for the third and fourth balls. Now we have one ready, place on your baking dish seam side down and brush the top with more butter. 
	<br>Repeat for the remaining 4 balls to make a second one. With your hands lightly press the folded feteer to spread it on the baking dish. 
	<br>Place in a 550F preheated oven for 10 minutes when the feteer starts puffing turn on the broiler to brown the top. 
	<br>When it is done add little butter on top and cover so it won't get dry.</li>
<ol>
<p>We will end up with two rounded feteer each made with 3or 4 of the dough balls. Each one will be around 10 inch. </p>
