  <h3>History Of Soba In Japan</h3>
  <p>
    The tradition of eating soba originates from the Tokugawa period,<br>
     also called the Edo period, from 1603 to 1868. In this period,<br>
      every neighborhood had one or two soba establishments,<br>
       many also serving sake, which functioned much like modern cafes<br>
        where locals would stop for a casual meal.

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>Set a large bowl on a damp paper towel to hold the bowl in place on work surface. <br>
        Sift buckwheat flour and all-purpose flour into bowl.<br>
         Measure 2 tablespoons chilled water into a small bowl,<br>
         set aside. Add remaining 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons chilled water to flour mixture;<br>
          using your fingertips, quickly toss until water is evenly incorporated. <br>
        Continue to toss until it forms a crumbly mixture, about 1 minute.
    </li>
    <li>Using the palms of your hands and working quickly, <br>
        rub dough in a circular motion until it begins to form small clumps,<br>
         about 2 minutes. If dough feels dry, add 1 tablespoon reserved chilled water.<br>
          Gather the small clumps, and shape them into a large ball. Transfer dough to a clean work surface,<br>
          and knead until it is semi-firm and smooth but not sticky, about 2 minutes. If dough still feels dry, <br>
          add remaining 1 tablespoon chilled water, kneading until dough is smooth and shiny with no visible cracks.<br>
           Press dough ball into a 1-inch-thick disk.

    </li>
    <li>Lightly dust dough and a large cutting board with tapioca starch. <br>
        Using a rolling pin, roll dough into an 18-inch square (about 1/8 inch thick). <br>
        (Do not flip the dough while rolling it out.)<br>
         Trim edges to create an even square.
    </li>
    <li>Generously sprinkle tapioca starch over left half of dough square; fold right half over.<br>
         Generously sprinkle tapioca starch over top half of dough rectangle;<br>
         fold bottom half up and over to form a 9-inch square with 4 layers of dough
    </li>
    <li>Starting along the right side, use a ruler and long knife (or a cutting guide and soba knife)<br>
         to cut the dough stack into thin (about 1/8-inch-thick) noodles.<br>
         Once all noodles are cut, working in batches, <br>
         gently shake off excess starch by tapping ends of noodles on cutting board.<br>
          Transfer noodles to a baking sheet, laying them flat. (Do not bundle.) <br>
          Cover with a clean towel, and wrap tightly with plastic wrap.<br>
         Refrigerate until ready to cook.
    </li>
    <li>Set a colander in a large bowl filled with ice water; set aside.<br>
         Bring an 8-quart pot of water to a rolling boil over high.<br>
          Gently drop 2 servings of noodles (about 12 ounces) into boiling water.<br>
           Cook noodles, without stirring, until al dente,<br>
         about 1 minute and 30 seconds.
    </li>
    <li>Using a large mesh strainer,<br>
         transfer noodles to colander set in ice water. <br>
         Remove colander from ice bath, and rinse noodles under cold running water. <br>
         Drain and rinse again. Drain thoroughly by tapping the side and bottom of colander (do not toss).<br>
          Divide noodles between 2 bowls.<br>
         Repeat cooking process in steps 6 and 7 with remaining noodles.
    </li>
